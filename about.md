Hello, my name is Ondřej Benkovský. I am a software engineer with 9+ years of experience in building robust
backend solutions ranging from various web application to low-level network services like DNS servers.
I specialize in building scalable backend solutions with a lot of experience in distributed and 
performance-sensitive applications for tackling real-world challenges efficiently.

My go-to programming languages are Java and GoLang, though I regularly work with other tools and programming languages 
depending on the needs of the project. I have extensive experience designing and running applications on cloud 
infrastructure and Kubernetes clusters.

Outside of coding, you’ll often find me immersed in a good fantasy book series, playing games on my computer or PlayStation,
playing board games, or enjoying nature through long walks. I am also passionate about traveling and love visiting historical sites.
